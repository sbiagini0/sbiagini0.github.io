An LR greater than 1 supports relatedness, while values below 1 support non-relatedness.\n🧪 Hypotheses in a Missing Person Identification (MPI) case In missing person investigations we rarely have a DNA profile from the missing person (MP) itself.\nInstead, we collect DNA from biological relatives (parents, siblings, aunts/uncles, grandparents) and compare those profiles with a person of interest (POI).\nThe figure below illustrates the two competing hypotheses that underlie the LR:\n$H_1$: POI = MP\nThe POI is assumed to occupy the missing person’s position in the pedigree.\nThe green square is both POI and MP, and the LR numerator is the probability of observing the relatives’ genotypes if the POI truly belongs in that family.\n$H_2$: POI is unrelated\nThe MP still belongs in the pedigree, but the POI is now placed outside the family, as an unrelated individual from the reference population.\nThe denominator of the LR is the probability of the same genetic data if the POI is just a random, unrelated person.\nThe LR summarizes how much more (or less) compatible the observed DNA is with the POI = MP scenario than with the POI unrelated scenario.\nThis pedigree allows the same set of typed individuals to be interpreted under different hypotheses-such as related versus unrelated-by changing only the biological connections between them.\nTo help interpret the diagrams, note that forensic pedigrees follow standard genetic notation:\nSquares represent males, and circles represent females. Unfilled symbols denote individuals without genetic data, whereas hatched or colored symbols indicate those who are genotyped or specifically highlighted in the analysis (e.g., the MP or typed reference relatives). Horizontal lines connect biological parents, and vertical lines descend from parents to their children. When multiple siblings are present, they share a single vertical line that branches horizontally. Generations are arranged from top to bottom, with older generations above and descendants below. 🎲 STR Kinship Simulations and Statistical Power To understand how well traditional STR markers perform in kinship inference, we can simulate thousands of conditioned profiles and calculate $\\log_{10}(LR)$ under both hypotheses:\nRelated (H1) - the POI truly belongs in the family. Unrelated (H2) - the POI is a random individual from the population. Pedigree:\nExample trio pedigree for STR-based kinship testing. The Missing Person (MP) and both relatives are genotyped at 24 autosomal STR markers.\nThe interactive figure below displays the resulting probability density curves for each scenario.\nThe red distribution corresponds to Unrelated cases, while the blue distribution corresponds to Related cases.\nVertical dashed lines mark the mean $\\log_{10}(LR)$ and the short vertical blue and red bars on the x-axis indicate the minimum and maximum observed values for each distribution.\nLR distributions:\nInteractive LR distributions derived from kinship simulations using forrel and the 24 STR markers; visualization created with Plotly in R.\nBecause STR panels contain a limited number of markers, the two distributions show a substantial overlap.\nThis overlap creates regions where:\nFalse positives occur (unrelated individuals with LR ≥ 1), and False negatives occur (related individuals with LR \u0026lt; 1). These regions are highlighted in the interactive plot. They represent outcomes where the statistical evidence would point in the wrong direction - a critical limitation when dealing with missing-person cases or distant relatives.\nAlthough STRs are powerful for close relationships, their discriminative ability declines significantly as biological distance increases, motivating the transition toward high-density SNP panels.\n🔍 How SNPs Enhance the Statistical Power of Kinship Inference SNP-based panels address many of the intrinsic limitations of STR markers.\nWhile STRs are informative but limited in number, Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are extremely abundant, allowing the construction of panels with thousands of loci distributed across the genome.\nA major methodological advantage is that SNP-based likelihood ratio models can explicitly incorporate linkage and linkage disequilibrium (LD).\nThis means that nearby markers are not assumed to be independent, and the LR calculation can correctly account for the inheritance of shared genomic segments.\nThis is particularly important when working with dense panels where many SNPs fall within the same haplotype block.\nThe FORCE panel, for example, contains 3,915 autosomal SNPs designed to maximize kinship resolution up to the 5th degree of relationship.\nBecause SNPs capture segment sharing and recombination patterns with high resolution, they markedly improve discriminatory power, even for distant or weak biological relationships.\n📊 SNP LR Distributions Across Degrees of Relatedness To demonstrate the practical impact of SNPs on kinship resolution, we simulated duo comparisons between a Missing Person (MP) and one relative at a time, separately for five degrees of biological relatedness.\nFor every scenario, we computed the $\\log_{10}(Linked LR)$ distributions assuming both Related and Unrelated hypotheses, using a likelihood framework that explicitly models marker linkage-a crucial requirement when working with highly dense SNP panels such as FORCE (3915 SNPs).\nEach degree of relationship is represented by a specific pedigree plot, followed by the corresponding LR density curves, illustrating how the separation between hypotheses evolves as the amount of shared DNA decreases.\n👨‍👦 1° Degree – Parent–child / Full siblings Pedigree:\nPedigree structure for SNP-based duo testing at the 1st degree of relatedness. The Missing Person (MP) and the close relative (parent–child or full sibling)\nLR distributions:\nInteractive LR curves generated from duo kinship simulations using the FORCE 3,915 markers SNP panel . Linked LR computed with Merlin and visualization rendered with Plotly in R.\nAt first degree, SNPs provide extremely strong discrimination.\nThe Related distribution lies entirely on the positive side of the LR axis (with very high values), while the Unrelated distribution collapses near $\\log_{10}(LR) = -308$, producing absolute separation.\nFalse positives or false negatives are essentially nonexistent.\n👨‍👩‍👦 2° Degree – Grandparent–grandchild / Avuncular / Half-Siblings Pedigree:\nPedigree structure for SNP-based duo testing at the 2nd degree of relatedness. The MP is compared to a grandparent, avuncular relative, or half sibling.\nLR distributions:\nInteractive LR curves generated from duo kinship simulations using the FORCE 3,915 markers SNP panel . Linked LR computed with Merlin and visualization rendered with Plotly in R.\nSecond-degree comparisons still show excellent separation.\nThe Related curve remains clearly to the right of the threshold, with high LR values, whereas the Unrelated distribution remains tightly concentrated near strongly negative values.\nEven with duo testing, the distance between the two distributions continues to be large.\n👨‍👧‍👦 3° Degree – Great-grandparent / Grand-Avuncular / First cousins Pedigree:\nPedigree structure for SNP-based duo kinship evaluation at the 3rd degree of relatedness. Only the MP and one extended relative are genotyped.\nLR distributions:\nInteractive LR curves generated from duo kinship simulations using the FORCE 3,915 markers SNP panel . Linked LR computed with Merlin and visualization rendered with Plotly in R.\nThird-degree relatives share less DNA, but the 3915-SNP panel retains strong resolution.\nThe related curve shifts left compared with earlier degrees, yet remains clearly separated from the unrelated distribution, without overlap.\nDense SNP panels still perform extremely well at this level.\n👪 4° Degree – First cousins once removed Pedigree:\nPedigree representation for SNP-based duo testing at the 4th degree of relatedness. The MP is typed together with first cousin once removed.\nLR distributions:\nInteractive LR curves generated from duo kinship simulations using the FORCE 3,915 markers SNP panel . Linked LR computed with Merlin and visualization rendered with Plotly in R.\nAt fourth degree, we begin to see overlap between the tails of the two distributions.\nThe Related curve moves closer to the zero threshold, and its lower tail overlaps slightly with the upper tail of the Unrelated distribution.\nThis marks the point where duo-only comparisons begin to lose significant discriminatory power.\nHowever, if additional relatives were included -even a single extra related of the MP-, the likelihood would accumulate more genetic data, moving the Related curve rightward and restoring a clean separation.\n🧑‍🤝‍🧑 5° Degree – Second cousins Pedigree:\nPedigree diagram for SNP-based duo inference at the 5th degree of relatedness. The MP and a second cousin are compared.\nLR distributions:\nInteractive LR curves generated from duo kinship simulations using the FORCE 3,915 markers SNP panel . Linked LR computed with Merlin and visualization rendered with Plotly in R.\nFifth-degree relationships show notable overlap between distributions in a duo scenario.\nThe proportion of shared DNA becomes small, and the variance in IBD sharing increases at distant relationships.\nDespite this, the Related curve still tends toward LR values above zero, reflecting real genetic relatedness.\nBut again, including additional relatives would add more inheritance constraints and almost certainly separate the curves enough to support a strong conclusion of relatedness.\nInterpretation note:\nIn SNP-based likelihood ratio distributions, the Unrelated curve is typically much narrower, taller, and shifted toward strongly negative $log10(Linked LR)$ values. This reflects the high probability that unrelated individuals share very little identical-by-descent (IBD) material.\nIn contrast, the Related curve is wider and more flattened. This broader dispersion arises from natural variability in shared genomic segments due to recombination and inheritance processes. As a result, related individuals span a wider range of $log10(Linked LR)$ values.\n💡 Concluding Remarks SNP-based kinship inference provides a significant enhancement in resolution compared to STRs, largely due to the availability of thousands of markers and the ability to model linkage between nearby loci.\nFor close and intermediate relatives (1st–3rd degree), SNP panels yield highly decisive LR values, even when only two individuals are available. For more distant relatives (4th–5th degree), some overlap emerges in duo comparisons, but the Related distribution still tends to remain distinguishable from the Unrelated one. Importantly, if additional relatives were included-moving from duo to trio or more complex pedigrees-the curves would separate further, substantially reducing the observed overlap. Overall, SNPs enable robust kinship inference well beyond the capacity of STRs, offering reliable statistical power even for challenging or distant biological relationships..\nThe future of forensic identification lies in the integration of these high-resolution genomic methods with robust statistical frameworks and ethical data control.\n📚 References Vigeland MD (2021).

They can be single base substitutions, insertions or deletions of fragments, or larger rearrangements. Most are neutral and do not directly affect the organism, but they are transmitted to offspring and accumulate over time. These mutations are the primary source of genetic variability, and their effects are complemented by other fundamental processes in population genetics:\nGenetic recombination, which shuffles variants during gamete formation and generates new allelic combinations in each generation. Natural selection, which favors beneficial variants and eliminates harmful ones, adapting populations to their environment. Genetic drift, random changes in allele frequencies, especially marked in small populations. Gene flow, the exchange of variants between populations through migration and interbreeding. Founder effect and bottlenecks, drastic reductions in genetic variability due to founding by a limited number of individuals or demographic crises. The interaction among these processes, acting on accumulated mutations, explains the genetic diversity observed in the human species and allows us to reconstruct evolutionary history across time and space.\nSource: Wellcome Genome Campus, “DNA mutations – point mutation”.\nLink to image – Licensed under CC BY 4.0.\n🔁⚙️ Genetic Variability as a Driver of Change Throughout the history of Homo sapiens, evolutionary processes interacted with natural barriers-deserts, mountain ranges, forests, and oceans-that limited contact between populations. Isolation promoted differentiation through drift, while migrations opened routes for gene flow and admixture, acting on standing and newly arisen variation.\nIn this context, mitochondrial DNA (maternal lineages) and Y chromosome (paternal lineages) allow us to trace direct lines of inheritance, while autosomal SNPs reflect the complete genetic mosaic resulting from the combination of both parental contributions. Studied together, these markers provide an integrated view of how our species originated in Africa and expanded across the globe, accumulating genetic variability over time and space.\nFigure created by the author with pedtools [Vigeland, 2020].\n🌍🧬 Mitochondrial Eve and Y-Chromosomal Adam: Markers of Origin The concepts of “Mitochondrial Eve” and “Y-Chromosomal Adam” are used in population genetics to describe the most recent common ancestors of our maternal and paternal lines, respectively.\nMitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is inherited exclusively through the maternal line: each person receives their mitochondria from their mother, and she from hers, in an unbroken chain. Thus, all living humans share a common maternal ancestor -the so-called Mitochondrial Eve- who lived in Africa between 150,000 and 200,000 years ago, represented by haplogroup L.

This allows tracing a continuous male lineage back to a common ancestor: the Y-Chromosomal Adam, who lived in Africa about 100,000 to 250,000 years ago.

For tens of thousands of years, human populations remained structured within Africa. Ecological fragmentation (savannah, Sahara desert, tropical forests) created geographic barriers that limited gene flow between groups. As a result, population differentiation was accentuated through genetic drift: random changes in allele frequencies due to small population sizes and stochastic transmission across generations.\n*Source: Wikipedia contributors. “Spreading Homo sapiens Latin America.”* Link to image – Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0.\nOut of Africa and Expansion into Eurasia Around 60,000–70,000 years ago, a subset of African lineages carrying defining mutations in mtDNA (haplogroup L3) and the Y chromosome (haplogroups C, D, and F, derived from African A and B) crossed northeastern Africa into the Middle East.\nThe main route followed the coast of the Red Sea and the Arabian Peninsula, where contact with new environments favored population bottlenecks that intensified genetic drift.\nFrom the Middle East, populations split: Some advanced into Europe about 45,000 years ago, largely replacing Neanderthals, though with evidence of gene flow from them (~1–2% of the current non-African genome derives from Neanderthals). Others moved into Central and East Asia, accumulating mutations that defined regional haplogroups (e.g., mtDNA M and N; Y haplogroups O and C). Geography played a crucial role in population structure: Mountain ranges such as the Caucasus, Himalayas, Urals, and Carpathians, and deserts such as the Sahara, Gobi, Taklamakan, Karakum, and Kyzylkum, limited direct contact between populations and promoted differentiation through isolation. Other barriers included the cold Siberian steppes, the Iranian plateau, and the Thar desert in India. Inland seas such as the Caspian Sea, Black Sea, and Aral Sea, as well as the eastern Mediterranean, sometimes acted as obstacles and sometimes as corridors of dispersal, depending on navigational technology. Source: Wikipedia contributors. “Expansion of early modern humans from Africa.”\nLink to image – Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0.\nExpansion into Oceania and the Americas In parallel, other groups moved into Southeast Asia and Oceania, reaching Australia at least 50,000 years ago. The colonization of these regions reflects both the accumulation of unique mutations in isolated lineages and the action of genetic drift in small founding populations.\nFinally, between 20,000 and 15,000 years ago, descendants of Siberian populations crossed the Bering Strait during the Last Glacial Maximum, when sea levels were lower. From there they expanded rapidly into North and South America. The colonization of the Americas illustrates a classic case of the founder effect: small groups carrying only a fraction of the original genetic variability, whose drift accentuated the relative homogeneity of Native American populations.\nSource: Wikimedia Commons. “Map of Beringia Bathymetry.”\nLink to image – Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0.\n🌐📊 The Modern Landscape of Human Genetic Diversity The study of genetic ancestry seeks to reconstruct human population history through inherited variations in our DNA. Among the most widely used markers are SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms), small single-base changes in the genome that, once accumulated and transmitted, reflect the species’ diversity.\nSNPs are used as ancestry markers because:\nThey represent the combined contribution of paternal and maternal inheritance, being located on autosomes. They reveal patterns of population differentiation resulting from mutations, drift, bottlenecks, and geographic isolation. Analyzed together, they make it possible to reconstruct migration trajectories and admixture processes, offering a global view of current human genetic variability. Thus, SNPs represent the complete genetic mosaic of each individual and have become the foundation of modern studies of human evolution and migration history.\nIf we follow the logic of anatomically modern humans originating in Africa and tracing their migratory routes through mutations as shown above-a pattern that can also be reproduced by analyzing 192 ancestry-informative SNPs across 79 modern populations-the African cluster emerges as the starting point of our species, from which the expansion into the Middle East and Europe forms intermediate groupings, while further away, yet still connected, the clusters of Southeast Asia, Oceania, and East Asia reflect those coastal eastward expansions.\nInteractive 3D PCA created by the author with Python. PCA computed using scikit-learn on a standardized allele-dosage matrix; visualization rendered with Plotly\nA PCA reduces genetic variation into three axes. Each point represents a population; if you hover over a point, you’ll see its name and PCA coordinates. You can also toggle populations on and off in the legend to explore the structure interactively\nIn contrast, the American cluster appears isolated and without direct connection to other continents. This evolutionary separation is explained by the fact that Native American populations descend from a reduced number of founders who crossed the Bering Strait. The subsequent long geographic isolation, together with the founder effect and drift, reduced variability and created a distinctive genetic profile. For this reason, in the PCA, the Americas appear far from Eurasia and Africa, showing a signature of isolation and differentiation that persisted until European colonization in 1492.\n🚢🔗 European Impact and the Admixture of the Americas The arrival of Europeans in the Americas from the 16th century onwards marked a turning point in the continent’s genetic history. Invasion and colonization involved not only political and cultural domination but also a deep reconfiguration of the genetic pool of American populations. With transoceanic navigation, the geographic barriers that had kept the continent isolated for tens of thousands of years were broken, allowing the entry of European and African lineages which, mixing with Native peoples, gave rise to new admixed populations across the continent.\nThree major currents shaped this transformation:\nEuropean colonizers, mainly from the Iberian Peninsula, who introduced lineages characteristic of Western Europe. The transatlantic slave trade, which forcibly transported millions of people from Africa, incorporating African genetic diversity in different parts of the Americas. The Native peoples, whose prior genetic heritage remained a central component, although in many cases diminished by massive mortality and demographic marginalization. In addition, massive European migrations between the 19th and 20th centuries brought millions of Italians, Spaniards, Portuguese, Germans, and other groups to the Americas. These flows, directed mainly toward North America and the Southern Cone, further reinforced the European genetic component and increased the diversity of admixture patterns observed today in countries such as the United States, Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay.\nThe result was the formation of admixed populations with varying degrees of European, African, and Native American contributions depending of the country history, which still define much of the genetic diversity in Latin America today.\nUsing the software FamLink2 and the FORCE reference database (4,323 SNPs from 7 populations), I simulated 250 unrelated admixed profiles between European and Native American populations. The simulation incorporated parameters such as theta/FST correction, mixed founders, and mutation models to more accurately reflect real demographic processes. The outcome is summarized in the following PCA:\nInteractive 3D PCA created by the author with Python. PCA computed using scikit-learn on a standardized allele-dosage matrix; simulations were performed using Famlink2 and FORCE SNP database; visualization rendered with Plotly\nThis PCA shows reference populations (displayed as clusters of individuals) together with simulated admixed individuals (grey points)\nThe simulated admixed profiles fall in intermediate positions between the European and Native American clusters, as expected. These intermediate positions form a genetic bridge connecting the two groups, illustrating how admixture links otherwise distinct population histories. Still, it is important to emphasize that Latin America is highly heterogeneous: the relative contributions of European, Native American, and African ancestries vary widely depending on the country and even within regions of the same country. For instance, Brazil and the Caribbean show stronger African components, while Andean and Amazonian regions often retain higher proportions of Native American ancestry. Thus, while the simulation highlights one major axis of variation (Europe–America), the broader Latin American genetic landscape is much more diverse and cannot be fully represented by a single model.\n💡 Concluding Remarks The genetic history of Homo sapiens is the history of its mutations, migrations, and admixtures. Each inherited variation functions as a record of the past, allowing us to reconstruct how our species left Africa, crossed natural barriers, and populated every continent. The European colonization of the Americas, with the incorporation of European and African lineages into the Native genetic pool, shows that in just a few centuries, population structures that had remained stable for millennia can be profoundly transformed - a process later reinforced by the massive waves of European immigration during the 19th and 20th centuries, which further reshaped the genetic landscape of the continent.\nIn short, human evolution does not stop: it will continue to be the result of the interaction between mutations and social processes which, as in the past, will keep shaping our diversity.\n📚 References Hamilton, M.

These mutations are the \u003cstrong\u003eprimary source of genetic variability\u003c/strong\u003e,\nand their effects are complemented by other fundamental processes in\npopulation genetics:\u003c/p\u003e","title":"The Genetic Map of Humanity: Mutation, Migrations and Admixture"}]
