They can be single base substitutions, insertions or deletions of fragments, or larger rearrangements. Most are neutral and do not directly affect the organism, but they are transmitted to offspring and accumulate over time. These mutations are the primary source of genetic variability, and their effects are complemented by other fundamental processes in population genetics:\nGenetic recombination, which shuffles variants during gamete formation and generates new allelic combinations in each generation. Natural selection, which favors beneficial variants and eliminates harmful ones, adapting populations to their environment. Genetic drift, random changes in allele frequencies, especially marked in small populations. Gene flow, the exchange of variants between populations through migration and interbreeding. Founder effect and bottlenecks, drastic reductions in genetic variability due to founding by a limited number of individuals or demographic crises. The interaction among these processes, acting on accumulated mutations, explains the genetic diversity observed in the human species and allows us to reconstruct evolutionary history across time and space.\nSource: Wellcome Genome Campus, “DNA mutations – point mutation”.\nLink to image – Licensed under CC BY 4.0.\n🔁⚙️ Genetic Variability as a Driver of Change Throughout the history of Homo sapiens, evolutionary processes interacted with natural barriers-deserts, mountain ranges, forests, and oceans-that limited contact between populations. Isolation promoted differentiation through drift, while migrations opened routes for gene flow and admixture, acting on standing and newly arisen variation.\nIn this context, mitochondrial DNA (maternal lineages) and Y chromosome (paternal lineages) allow us to trace direct lines of inheritance, while autosomal SNPs reflect the complete genetic mosaic resulting from the combination of both parental contributions. Studied together, these markers provide an integrated view of how our species originated in Africa and expanded across the globe, accumulating genetic variability over time and space.\nFigure created by the author with pedtools [Vigeland, 2020].\n🌍🧬 Mitochondrial Eve and Y-Chromosomal Adam: Markers of Origin The concepts of “Mitochondrial Eve” and “Y-Chromosomal Adam” are used in population genetics to describe the most recent common ancestors of our maternal and paternal lines, respectively.\nMitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is inherited exclusively through the maternal line: each person receives their mitochondria from their mother, and she from hers, in an unbroken chain. Thus, all living humans share a common maternal ancestor -the so-called Mitochondrial Eve- who lived in Africa between 150,000 and 200,000 years ago, represented by haplogroup L.

This allows tracing a continuous male lineage back to a common ancestor: the Y-Chromosomal Adam, who lived in Africa about 100,000 to 250,000 years ago. Source: Wikipedia contributors. “Human Y-chromosome haplogroups.”\nLink to image – Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0.\nThese two modes of inheritance -maternal and paternal- act as direct lines that preserve mutations over time, serving as “markers of origin.” By analyzing them, it is possible to reconstruct how human populations diverged, crossed natural barriers, and expanded through migrations, giving rise to today’s diversity.\n🗺️🧭 Routes and Barriers: The Expanding Map African Origin and Initial Diversification Anatomically modern Homo sapiens arose in Africa around 200,000 years ago. For tens of thousands of years, human populations remained structured within Africa. Ecological fragmentation (savannah, Sahara desert, tropical forests) created geographic barriers that limited gene flow between groups. As a result, population differentiation was accentuated through genetic drift: random changes in allele frequencies due to small population sizes and stochastic transmission across generations.\n*Source: Wikipedia contributors. “Spreading Homo sapiens Latin America.”* Link to image – Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0.\nOut of Africa and Expansion into Eurasia Around 60,000–70,000 years ago, a subset of African lineages carrying defining mutations in mtDNA (haplogroup L3) and the Y chromosome (haplogroups C, D, and F, derived from African A and B) crossed northeastern Africa into the Middle East.\nThe main route followed the coast of the Red Sea and the Arabian Peninsula, where contact with new environments favored population bottlenecks that intensified genetic drift.\nFrom the Middle East, populations split: Some advanced into Europe about 45,000 years ago, largely replacing Neanderthals, though with evidence of gene flow from them (~1–2% of the current non-African genome derives from Neanderthals). Others moved into Central and East Asia, accumulating mutations that defined regional haplogroups (e.g., mtDNA M and N; Y haplogroups O and C). Geography played a crucial role in population structure: Mountain ranges such as the Caucasus, Himalayas, Urals, and Carpathians, and deserts such as the Sahara, Gobi, Taklamakan, Karakum, and Kyzylkum, limited direct contact between populations and promoted differentiation through isolation. Other barriers included the cold Siberian steppes, the Iranian plateau, and the Thar desert in India. Inland seas such as the Caspian Sea, Black Sea, and Aral Sea, as well as the eastern Mediterranean, sometimes acted as obstacles and sometimes as corridors of dispersal, depending on navigational technology.

The colonization of these regions reflects both the accumulation of unique mutations in isolated lineages and the action of genetic drift in small founding populations.\nFinally, between 20,000 and 15,000 years ago, descendants of Siberian populations crossed the Bering Strait during the Last Glacial Maximum, when sea levels were lower. From there they expanded rapidly into North and South America. The colonization of the Americas illustrates a classic case of the founder effect: small groups carrying only a fraction of the original genetic variability, whose drift accentuated the relative homogeneity of Native American populations.\nSource: Wikimedia Commons. “Map of Beringia Bathymetry.”\nLink to image – Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0.\n🌐📊 The Modern Landscape of Human Genetic Diversity The study of genetic ancestry seeks to reconstruct human population history through inherited variations in our DNA. Among the most widely used markers are SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms), small single-base changes in the genome that, once accumulated and transmitted, reflect the species’ diversity.\nSNPs are used as ancestry markers because:\nThey represent the combined contribution of paternal and maternal inheritance, being located on autosomes. They reveal patterns of population differentiation resulting from mutations, drift, bottlenecks, and geographic isolation. Analyzed together, they make it possible to reconstruct migration trajectories and admixture processes, offering a global view of current human genetic variability. Thus, SNPs represent the complete genetic mosaic of each individual and have become the foundation of modern studies of human evolution and migration history.\nIf we follow the logic of anatomically modern humans originating in Africa and tracing their migratory routes through mutations as shown above-a pattern that can also be reproduced by analyzing 192 ancestry-informative SNPs across 79 modern populations-the African cluster emerges as the starting point of our species, from which the expansion into the Middle East and Europe forms intermediate groupings, while further away, yet still connected, the clusters of Southeast Asia, Oceania, and East Asia reflect those coastal eastward expansions.\nInteractive 3D PCA created by the author with Python. PCA computed using scikit-learn on a standardized allele-dosage matrix; visualization rendered with Plotly\nA PCA reduces genetic variation into three axes. Each point represents a population; if you hover over a point, you’ll see its name and PCA coordinates. You can also toggle populations on and off in the legend to explore the structure interactively\nIn contrast, the American cluster appears isolated and without direct connection to other continents. This evolutionary separation is explained by the fact that Native American populations descend from a reduced number of founders who crossed the Bering Strait. The subsequent long geographic isolation, together with the founder effect and drift, reduced variability and created a distinctive genetic profile. For this reason, in the PCA, the Americas appear far from Eurasia and Africa, showing a signature of isolation and differentiation that persisted until European colonization in 1492.\n🚢🔗 European Impact and the Admixture of the Americas The arrival of Europeans in the Americas from the 16th century onwards marked a turning point in the continent’s genetic history. Invasion and colonization involved not only political and cultural domination but also a deep reconfiguration of the genetic pool of American populations. With transoceanic navigation, the geographic barriers that had kept the continent isolated for tens of thousands of years were broken, allowing the entry of European and African lineages which, mixing with Native peoples, gave rise to new admixed populations across the continent.\nThree major currents shaped this transformation:\nEuropean colonizers, mainly from the Iberian Peninsula, who introduced lineages characteristic of Western Europe. The transatlantic slave trade, which forcibly transported millions of people from Africa, incorporating African genetic diversity in different parts of the Americas. The Native peoples, whose prior genetic heritage remained a central component, although in many cases diminished by massive mortality and demographic marginalization. In addition, massive European migrations between the 19th and 20th centuries brought millions of Italians, Spaniards, Portuguese, Germans, and other groups to the Americas. These flows, directed mainly toward North America and the Southern Cone, further reinforced the European genetic component and increased the diversity of admixture patterns observed today in countries such as the United States, Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay.\nThe result was the formation of admixed populations with varying degrees of European, African, and Native American contributions depending of the country history, which still define much of the genetic diversity in Latin America today.\nUsing the software FamLink2 and the FORCE reference database (4,323 SNPs from 7 populations), I simulated 250 unrelated admixed profiles between European and Native American populations. The simulation incorporated parameters such as theta/FST correction, mixed founders, and mutation models to more accurately reflect real demographic processes. The outcome is summarized in the following PCA:\nInteractive 3D PCA created by the author with Python. PCA computed using scikit-learn on a standardized allele-dosage matrix; simulations were performed using Famlink2 and FORCE SNP database; visualization rendered with Plotly\nThis PCA shows reference populations (displayed as clusters of individuals) together with simulated admixed individuals (grey points)\nThe simulated admixed profiles fall in intermediate positions between the European and Native American clusters, as expected. These intermediate positions form a genetic bridge connecting the two groups, illustrating how admixture links otherwise distinct population histories. Still, it is important to emphasize that Latin America is highly heterogeneous: the relative contributions of European, Native American, and African ancestries vary widely depending on the country and even within regions of the same country. For instance, Brazil and the Caribbean show stronger African components, while Andean and Amazonian regions often retain higher proportions of Native American ancestry. Thus, while the simulation highlights one major axis of variation (Europe–America), the broader Latin American genetic landscape is much more diverse and cannot be fully represented by a single model.\n🧠 Concluding Remarks The genetic history of Homo sapiens is the history of its mutations, migrations, and admixtures. Each inherited variation functions as a record of the past, allowing us to reconstruct how our species left Africa, crossed natural barriers, and populated every continent. The European colonization of the Americas, with the incorporation of European and African lineages into the Native genetic pool, shows that in just a few centuries, population structures that had remained stable for millennia can be profoundly transformed - a process later reinforced by the massive waves of European immigration during the 19th and 20th centuries, which further reshaped the genetic landscape of the continent.\nIn short, human evolution does not stop: it will continue to be the result of the interaction between mutations and social processes which, as in the past, will keep shaping our diversity.\n📚 References Hamilton, M.
