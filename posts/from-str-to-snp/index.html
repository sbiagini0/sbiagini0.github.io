An LR greater than 1 supports relatedness, while values below 1 support non-relatedness.\n🧪 Hypotheses in a Missing Person Identification (MPI) case In missing person investigations we rarely have a DNA profile from the missing person (MP) itself.\nInstead, we collect DNA from biological relatives (parents, siblings, aunts/uncles, grandparents) and compare those profiles with a person of interest (POI).\nThe figure below illustrates the two competing hypotheses that underlie the LR:\n$H_1$: POI = MP\nThe POI is assumed to occupy the missing person’s position in the pedigree.\nThe green square is both POI and MP, and the LR numerator is the probability of observing the relatives’ genotypes if the POI truly belongs in that family.\n$H_2$: POI unrelated\nThe MP still belongs in the pedigree, but the POI is now placed outside the family, as an unrelated individual from the reference population.\nThe denominator of the LR is the probability of the same genetic data if the POI is just a random, unrelated person.\nThe LR summarizes how much more (or less) compatible the observed DNA is with the POI = MP scenario than with the POI unrelated scenario.\nThis pedigree allows the same set of typed individuals to be interpreted under different hypotheses-such as related versus unrelated-by changing only the biological connections between them.\nTo help interpret the diagrams, note that forensic pedigrees follow standard genetic notation:\nSquares represent males, and circles represent females. Unfilled symbols denote individuals without genetic data, whereas hatched or colored symbols indicate those who are genotyped or specifically highlighted in the analysis (e.g., the MP or typed reference relatives). Horizontal lines connect biological parents, and vertical lines descend from parents to their children. When multiple siblings are present, they share a single vertical line that branches horizontally. Generations are arranged from top to bottom, with older generations above and descendants below. 🎲 STR Kinship Simulations and Statistical Power To understand how well traditional STR panels perform in kinship inference, we can simulate thousands of conditioned profiles and calculate $\\log_{10}(LR)$\nvalues under both hypotheses:\nRelated (H1) - the POI truly belongs in the family. Unrelated (H2) - the POI is a random individual from the population. Pedigree:\nExample trio pedigree for STR-based kinship testing. The Missing Person (MP) and both relatives are genotyped at 24 autosomal STR markers.\nThe interactive figure below displays the resulting probability density curves for each scenario.\nThe red distribution corresponds to Unrelated cases, while the blue distribution corresponds to Related cases.\nVertical dashed lines mark the mean $\\log_{10}(LR)$ and the short vertical blue and red bars on the x-axis indicate the minimum and maximum observed values for each distribution.\nLR distributions:\nInteractive LR distributions derived from kinship simulations using forrel and the 24 STR markers; visualization created with Plotly in R.\nBecause STR panels contain a limited number of markers, the two distributions show a substantial overlap.\nThis overlap creates regions where:\nFalse positives occur (unrelated individuals with LR ≥ 1), and False negatives occur (related individuals with LR \u003c 1). These regions are highlighted in the interactive plot. They represent outcomes where the statistical evidence would point in the wrong direction - a critical limitation when dealing with missing-person cases or distant relatives.\nAlthough STRs are powerful for close relationships, their discriminative ability declines sharply as biological distance increases, motivating the transition toward high-density SNP panels.\n🔍 From STR to SNP: Increasing Resolution SNP-based panels address many of the intrinsic limitations of STR markers.\nWhile STRs are informative but limited in number, Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are extremely abundant, allowing the construction of panels with thousands of loci distributed across the genome.\nA major methodological advantage is that SNP-based likelihood ratio models can explicitly incorporate linkage and linkage disequilibrium (LD).\nThis means that nearby markers are not assumed to be independent, and the LR calculation can correctly account for the inheritance of shared genomic segments.\nThis is particularly important when working with dense panels where many SNPs fall within the same haplotype block.\nThe FORCE panel, for example, contains 3,915 autosomal SNPs designed to maximize kinship resolution up to the 5th degree of relationship.\nBecause SNPs capture segment sharing and recombination signals with high granularity, they markedly improve discriminatory power, even for distant or weak biological relationships.\nIn the following sections, we analyze SNP performance in duo-based kinship comparisons between an individual of interest (e.g., a Missing Person) and relatives spanning the first to fifth degree.\nFor each degree, we simulate the expected $\\log_{10}(Linked LR)$ distributions under both Related and Unrelated hypotheses.\n📊 SNP LR Distributions Across Degrees of Relatedness To demonstrate the practical impact of SNPs on kinship resolution, we simulated duo comparisons between a Missing Person (MP) and one relative at a time, separately for five degrees of biological relatedness.\nFor every scenario, we computed the $\\log_{10}(Linked LR)$ distributions assuming both Related and Unrelated hypotheses, using a likelihood framework that explicitly models marker linkage-a crucial requirement when working with highly dense SNP panels such as FORCE (3915 SNPs).\nEach degree of relationship is represented by a specific pedigree diagram, followed by the corresponding LR density curves, illustrating how the separation between hypotheses evolves as the amount of shared DNA decreases.\n👨‍👦 1° Degree – Parent–child / Full siblings Pedigree:\nPedigree structure for SNP-based duo testing at the 1st degree of relatedness. The Missing Person (MP) and the close relative (parent–child or full sibling)\nLR distributions:\nInteractive LR curves generated from duo kinship simulations using the FORCE 3,915 markers SNP panel . Linked LR computed with Merlin and visualization rendered with Plotly in R.\nAt first degree, SNPs provide extremely strong discrimination.\nThe Related distribution lies entirely on the positive side of the LR axis (with very high values), while the Unrelated distribution collapses near $\\log_{10}(LR)$ = -308, producing absolute separation.\nFalse positives or false negatives are essentially nonexistent.\n👨‍👩‍👦 2° Degree – Grandparent–grandchild / Avuncular / Half-Siblings Pedigree:\nPedigree structure for SNP-based duo testing at the 2nd degree of relatedness. The MP is compared to a grandparent, avuncular relative, or half sibling.\nLR distributions:\nInteractive LR curves generated from duo kinship simulations using the FORCE 3,915 markers SNP panel . Linked LR computed with Merlin and visualization rendered with Plotly in R.\nSecond-degree comparisons still show excellent separation.\nThe Related curve remains clearly to the right of the threshold, with high LR values, whereas the Unrelated distribution remains tightly concentrated near strongly negative values.\nEven with duo testing (only two individuals), the distance between the two distributions continues to be large.\n👨‍👧‍👦 3° Degree – Great-grandparent / Grand-Avuncular / First cousins Pedigree:\nPedigree structure for SNP-based duo kinship evaluation at the 3rd degree of relatedness. Only the MP and one extended relative are genotyped.\nLR distributions:\nInteractive LR curves generated from duo kinship simulations using the FORCE 3,915 markers SNP panel . Linked LR computed with Merlin and visualization rendered with Plotly in R.\nThird-degree relatives share less DNA, but the 3915-SNP panel retains strong resolution.\nThe related curve shifts left compared with earlier degrees, yet remains clearly separated from the unrelated distribution, without overlap.\nDense SNP panels still perform extremely well at this level.\n👪 4° Degree – First cousins once removed Pedigree:\nPedigree representation for SNP-based duo testing at the 4th degree of relatedness. The MP is typed together with first cousin once removed.\nLR distributions:\nInteractive LR curves generated from duo kinship simulations using the FORCE 3,915 markers SNP panel . Linked LR computed with Merlin and visualization rendered with Plotly in R.\nAt fourth degree, we begin to see overlap between the tails of the two distributions.\nThe Related curve moves closer to the zero threshold, and its lower tail overlaps slightly with the upper tail of the Unrelated distribution.\nThis marks the point where duo-only comparisons begin to lose perfect discriminatory power.\nHowever, if additional relatives were included, even one related of the MP or the reference individual, the likelihood would accumulate more genetic data, shifting the Related curve rightward and restoring a clean separation.\n🧑‍🤝‍🧑 5° Degree – Second cousins Pedigree:\nPedigree diagram for SNP-based duo inference at the 5th degree of relatedness. The MP and a second cousin are compared.\nLR distributions:\nInteractive LR curves generated from duo kinship simulations using the FORCE 3,915 markers SNP panel . Linked LR computed with Merlin and visualization rendered with Plotly in R.\nFifth-degree relationships show notable overlap between distributions in a duo scenario.\nThis is expected: the proportion of shared DNA becomes small, and the variance in IBD sharing increases at distant relationships.\nDespite this, the Related curve still tends toward LR values above zero, evidencing genuine kinship signal.\nBut again: including additional relatives would add more inheritance constraints and almost certainly separate the curves enough to achieve a strong inclusionary conclusion.\nSNP-based likelihoods scale very efficiently with additional pedigree information.\nInterpretation note:\nIn SNP-based likelihood ratio distributions, the Unrelated curve is typically much narrower, taller, and shifted toward strongly negative log10(Linked LR) values. This reflects the high probability that unrelated individuals share very little identical-by-descent (IBD) material.\nIn contrast, the Related curve is wider and more flattened. This broader dispersion arises from natural variability in shared genomic segments due to recombination and inheritance processes. As a result, related individuals span a wider range of log₁₀(LR) values.\n💡 Concluding Remarks SNP-based kinship inference provides a major leap in resolution compared to STRs, largely due to the availability of thousands of markers and the ability to model linkage between nearby loci.\nFor close and intermediate relatives (1st–3rd degree), SNP panels yield highly decisive LR values, even when only two individuals are available. For more distant relatives (4th–5th degree), some overlap emerges in duo comparisons, but the Related distribution still tends to remain distinguishable from the Unrelated one. Importantly, if additional relatives were included-moving from duo to trio or more complex pedigrees-the curves would separate further, substantially reducing the observed overlap. Overall, SNPs enable robust kinship inference well beyond the capacity of STRs, offering reliable statistical power even for challenging or distant biological relationships..\nThe future of forensic identification lies in the integration of these high-resolution genomic methods with robust statistical frameworks and ethical data control.\n📚 References Vigeland MD (2021).
