Thus, all living humans share a common maternal ancestor -the so-called Mitochondrial Eve- who lived in Africa between 150,000 and 200,000 years ago, represented by haplogroup L.

This allows tracing a continuous male lineage back to a common ancestor: the Y-Chromosomal Adam, who lived in Africa about 100,000 to 250,000 years ago.

For tens of thousands of years, human populations remained structured within Africa. Ecological fragmentation (savannah, Sahara desert, tropical forests) created geographic barriers that limited gene flow between groups. As a result, population differentiation was accentuated through genetic drift: random changes in allele frequencies due to small population sizes and stochastic transmission across generations.\n*Source: Wikipedia contributors. ‚ÄúSpreading Homo sapiens Latin America.‚Äù* Link to image ‚Äì Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0.\nOut of Africa and Expansion into Eurasia Around 60,000‚Äì70,000 years ago, a subset of African lineages carrying defining mutations in mtDNA (haplogroup L3) and the Y chromosome (haplogroups C, D, and F, derived from African A and B) crossed northeastern Africa into the Middle East.\nThe main route followed the coast of the Red Sea and the Arabian Peninsula, where contact with new environments favored population bottlenecks that intensified genetic drift.\nFrom the Middle East, populations split: Some advanced into Europe about 45,000 years ago, largely replacing Neanderthals, though with evidence of gene flow from them (~1‚Äì2% of the current non-African genome derives from Neanderthals). Others moved into Central and East Asia, accumulating mutations that defined regional haplogroups (e.g., mtDNA M and N; Y haplogroups O and C). Geography played a crucial role in population structure: Mountain ranges such as the Caucasus, Himalayas, Urals, and Carpathians, and deserts such as the Sahara, Gobi, Taklamakan, Karakum, and Kyzylkum, limited direct contact between populations and promoted differentiation through isolation. Other barriers included the cold Siberian steppes, the Iranian plateau, and the Thar desert in India. Inland seas such as the Caspian Sea, Black Sea, and Aral Sea, as well as the eastern Mediterranean, sometimes acted as obstacles and sometimes as corridors of dispersal, depending on navigational technology.

The colonization of these regions reflects both the accumulation of unique mutations in isolated lineages and the action of genetic drift in small founding populations.\nFinally, between 20,000 and 15,000 years ago, descendants of Siberian populations crossed the Bering Strait during the Last Glacial Maximum, when sea levels were lower. From there they expanded rapidly into North and South America. The colonization of the Americas illustrates a classic case of the founder effect: small groups carrying only a fraction of the original genetic variability, whose drift accentuated the relative homogeneity of Native American populations.\nSource: Wikimedia Commons. ‚ÄúMap of Beringia Bathymetry.‚Äù\nLink to image ‚Äì Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0.\nüåêüìä The Modern Landscape of Human Genetic Diversity The study of genetic ancestry seeks to reconstruct human population history through inherited variations in our DNA. Among the most widely used markers are SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms), small single-base changes in the genome that, once accumulated and transmitted, reflect the species‚Äô diversity.\nSNPs are used as ancestry markers because:\nThey represent the combined contribution of paternal and maternal inheritance, being located on autosomes. They reveal patterns of population differentiation resulting from mutations, drift, bottlenecks, and geographic isolation. Analyzed together, they make it possible to reconstruct migration trajectories and admixture processes, offering a global view of current human genetic variability. Thus, SNPs represent the complete genetic mosaic of each individual and have become the foundation of modern studies of human evolution and migration history.\nIf we follow the logic of anatomically modern humans originating in Africa and tracing their migratory routes through mutations as shown above-a pattern that can also be reproduced by analyzing 192 ancestry-informative SNPs across 79 modern populations-the African cluster emerges as the starting point of our species, from which the expansion into the Middle East and Europe forms intermediate groupings, while further away, yet still connected, the clusters of Southeast Asia, Oceania, and East Asia reflect those coastal eastward expansions.\nInteractive 3D PCA created by the author with Python. PCA computed using scikit-learn on a standardized allele-dosage matrix; visualization rendered with Plotly\nA PCA reduces genetic variation into three axes. Each point represents a population; if you hover over a point, you‚Äôll see its name and PCA coordinates. You can also toggle populations on and off in the legend to explore the structure interactively\nIn contrast, the American cluster appears isolated and without direct connection to other continents. This evolutionary separation is explained by the fact that Native American populations descend from a reduced number of founders who crossed the Bering Strait. The subsequent long geographic isolation, together with the founder effect and drift, reduced variability and created a distinctive genetic profile. For this reason, in the PCA, the Americas appear far from Eurasia and Africa, showing a signature of isolation and differentiation that persisted until European colonization in 1492.\nüö¢üîó European Impact and the Admixture of the Americas The arrival of Europeans in the Americas from the 16th century onwards marked a turning point in the continent‚Äôs genetic history. Invasion and colonization involved not only political and cultural domination but also a deep reconfiguration of the genetic pool of American populations. With transoceanic navigation, the geographic barriers that had kept the continent isolated for tens of thousands of years were broken, allowing the entry of European and African lineages which, mixing with Native peoples, gave rise to new admixed populations across the continent.\nThree major currents shaped this transformation:\nEuropean colonizers, mainly from the Iberian Peninsula, who introduced lineages characteristic of Western Europe. The transatlantic slave trade, which forcibly transported millions of people from Africa, incorporating African genetic diversity in different parts of the Americas. The Native peoples, whose prior genetic heritage remained a central component, although in many cases diminished by massive mortality and demographic marginalization. In addition, massive European migrations between the 19th and 20th centuries brought millions of Italians, Spaniards, Portuguese, Germans, and other groups to the Americas. These flows, directed mainly toward North America and the Southern Cone, further reinforced the European genetic component and increased the diversity of admixture patterns observed today in countries such as the United States, Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay.\nThe result was the formation of admixed populations with varying degrees of European, African, and Native American contributions depending of the country history, which still define much of the genetic diversity in Latin America today.\nUsing the software FamLink2 and the FORCE reference database (4,323 SNPs from 7 populations), I simulated 250 unrelated admixed profiles between European and Native American populations. The simulation incorporated parameters such as theta/FST correction, mixed founders, and mutation models to more accurately reflect real demographic processes. The outcome is summarized in the following PCA:\nInteractive 3D PCA created by the author with Python. PCA computed using scikit-learn on a standardized allele-dosage matrix; simulations were performed using Famlink2 and FORCE SNP database; visualization rendered with Plotly\nThis PCA shows reference populations (displayed as clusters of individuals) together with simulated admixed individuals (grey points)\nThe simulated admixed profiles fall in intermediate positions between the European and Native American clusters, as expected. These intermediate positions form a genetic bridge connecting the two groups, illustrating how admixture links otherwise distinct population histories. Still, it is important to emphasize that Latin America is highly heterogeneous: the relative contributions of European, Native American, and African ancestries vary widely depending on the country and even within regions of the same country. For instance, Brazil and the Caribbean show stronger African components, while Andean and Amazonian regions often retain higher proportions of Native American ancestry. Thus, while the simulation highlights one major axis of variation (Europe‚ÄìAmerica), the broader Latin American genetic landscape is much more diverse and cannot be fully represented by a single model.\nüß† Concluding Remarks The genetic history of Homo sapiens is the history of its mutations, migrations, and admixtures. Each inherited variation functions as a record of the past, allowing us to reconstruct how our species left Africa, crossed natural barriers, and populated every continent. The European colonization of the Americas, with the incorporation of European and African lineages into the Native genetic pool, shows that in just a few centuries, population structures that had remained stable for millennia can be profoundly transformed - a process later reinforced by the massive waves of European immigration during the 19th and 20th centuries, which further reshaped the genetic landscape of the continent.\nIn short, human evolution does not stop: it will continue to be the result of the interaction between mutations and social processes which, as in the past, will keep shaping our diversity.\nüìö References Hamilton, M.

history through inherited variations in our DNA. Among the most widely
used markers are <strong>SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms)</strong>, small
single-base changes in the genome that, once accumulated and
transmitted, reflect the species‚Äô diversity.</p><p>SNPs are used as ancestry markers because:</p><ul><li>They represent the <strong>combined contribution of paternal and maternal
inheritance</strong>, being located on autosomes.</li><li>They reveal patterns of <strong>population differentiation</strong> resulting from
mutations, drift, bottlenecks, and geographic isolation.</li><li>Analyzed together, they make it possible to reconstruct <strong>migration
trajectories and admixture processes</strong>, offering a global view of
current human genetic variability.</li></ul><p>Thus, SNPs represent the <strong>complete genetic mosaic</strong> of each individual
and have become the foundation of modern studies of human evolution and
migration history.</p><p>If we follow the logic of <strong>anatomically modern humans</strong> originating in
Africa and tracing their migratory routes through mutations as shown
above-a pattern that can also be reproduced by analyzing 192
ancestry-informative SNPs across 79 modern populations-the <strong>African
cluster</strong> emerges as the starting point of our species, from which the
expansion into the <strong>Middle East and Europe</strong> forms intermediate
groupings, while further away, yet still connected, the clusters of
<strong>Southeast Asia, Oceania, and East Asia</strong> reflect those coastal
eastward expansions.</p><div style="width:100%;max-width:700px;margin:1rem auto"><iframe src=/pca/pca3d_refs.html title="PCA 3D ‚Äî Populations" style=display:block;width:100%;height:580px;border:0;overflow:hidden loading=lazy allowfullscreen scrolling=no></iframe></div><p><em>Interactive 3D PCA created by the author with Python.

Each point represents a population;

You can also toggle populations on and off in the legend to explore the structure interactively</p></blockquote><p>In contrast, the <strong>American cluster</strong> appears isolated and without
direct connection to other continents. This evolutionary separation is
explained by the fact that Native American populations descend from a
reduced number of founders who crossed the <strong>Bering Strait</strong>. The
subsequent long geographic isolation, together with the founder effect
and drift, reduced variability and created a distinctive genetic
profile. For this reason, in the PCA, the Americas appear far from
Eurasia and Africa, showing a signature of isolation and differentiation
that persisted until European colonization in 1492.</p><hr><h1 id=-european-impact-and-the-admixture-of-the-americas>üö¢üîó European Impact and the Admixture of the Americas<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-european-impact-and-the-admixture-of-the-americas>#</a></h1><p>The arrival of Europeans in the Americas from the 16th century onwards
marked a turning point in the continent‚Äôs genetic history. Invasion and
colonization involved not only political and cultural domination but
also a deep <strong>reconfiguration of the genetic pool</strong> of American
populations. With transoceanic navigation, the <strong>geographic barriers</strong>
that had kept the continent isolated for tens of thousands of years were
broken, allowing the entry of European and African lineages which,
mixing with Native peoples, gave rise to new <strong>admixed populations</strong>
across the continent.</p><p>Three major currents shaped this transformation:</p><ul><li><strong>European colonizers</strong>, mainly from the Iberian Peninsula, who
introduced lineages characteristic of Western Europe.</li><li>The <strong>transatlantic slave trade</strong>, which forcibly transported millions
of people from Africa, incorporating African genetic diversity in
different parts of the Americas.</li><li>The <strong>Native peoples</strong>, whose prior genetic heritage remained a
central component, although in many cases diminished by massive
mortality and demographic marginalization.</li></ul><p>In addition, <strong>massive European migrations</strong> between the 19th and 20th
centuries brought millions of Italians, Spaniards, Portuguese, Germans,
and other groups to the Americas. These flows, directed mainly toward
North America and the Southern Cone, further reinforced the European
genetic component and increased the diversity of admixture patterns
observed today in countries such as the United States, Argentina,
Brazil, and Uruguay.</p><p>The result was the formation of <strong>admixed populations</strong> with varying
degrees of European, African, and Native American contributions depending of the country history,
which still define much of the genetic diversity in Latin America today.</p><p>Using the software <strong>FamLink2</strong> and the <strong>FORCE reference database</strong> (4,323
SNPs from 7 populations), I simulated <strong>250 unrelated admixed profiles</strong> between
<strong>European and Native American populations</strong>. The simulation incorporated
parameters such as theta/FST correction, mixed founders, and
mutation models to more accurately reflect real demographic
processes. The outcome is summarized in the following PCA:</p><div style="width:100%;max-width:700px;margin:1rem auto"><iframe src=/pca/pca3d_admixed.html title="PCA 3D ‚Äî Populations and Samples" style=display:block;width:100%;height:580px;border:0;overflow:hidden loading=lazy allowfullscreen scrolling=no></iframe></div><p><em>Interactive 3D PCA created by the author with Python. PCA computed using scikit-learn on a standardized allele-dosage matrix; simulations were performed using Famlink2 and FORCE SNP database; visualization rendered with Plotly</em></p><blockquote><p>This PCA shows reference populations (displayed as clusters of individuals)
together with simulated admixed individuals (grey points)</p></blockquote><p>The <strong>simulated admixed profiles</strong> fall in intermediate positions between the <strong>European and Native American clusters</strong>,
as expected. These intermediate positions form a <strong>genetic bridge</strong> connecting the two groups,
illustrating how admixture links otherwise distinct population histories.
Still, it is important to emphasize that <strong>Latin America is highly heterogeneous</strong>:
the relative contributions of European, Native American, and African ancestries vary widely
depending on the country and even within regions of the same country. For instance, Brazil and
the Caribbean show stronger African components, while Andean and Amazonian regions often retain
higher proportions of Native American ancestry. Thus, while the simulation highlights one
major axis of variation (Europe‚ÄìAmerica), the broader Latin American genetic landscape is
much more diverse and cannot be fully represented by a single model.</p><hr><h1 id=-concluding-remarks>üß† Concluding Remarks<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-concluding-remarks>#</a></h1><p>The genetic history of <em>Homo sapiens</em> is the history of its <strong>mutations,
migrations, and admixtures</strong>. Each inherited variation functions as a
record of the past, allowing us to reconstruct how our species left
Africa, crossed natural barriers, and populated every continent. The
European colonization of the Americas, with the incorporation of
European and African lineages into the Native genetic pool, shows that
in just a few centuries, population structures that had remained stable
for millennia can be profoundly transformed - a process later reinforced
by the massive waves of European immigration during the 19th and 20th
centuries, which further reshaped the genetic landscape of the
continent.</p><p>In short, human evolution does not stop: it will continue to be the
result of the interaction between <strong>mutations</strong> and <strong>social processes</strong>
which, as in the past, will keep shaping our diversity.</p><hr><h1 id=-references>üìö References<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-references>#</a></h1><ul><li>Hamilton, M. B.
